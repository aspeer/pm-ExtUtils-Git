	* support/dist_ci.inc: Minfor change on branch target in Makefile,
	make brache tags end in "xxx-0", rather thant "xxx-2". No real

	* CVS.pm: Finished ci_mtime_sync method, allows mtime of file to be
	synced back to the CVS mtime, thus making mtime checks module files
	more robost, as an update -C does not fool it into thinking a file
	has changed, just because its mtime has.
	
	No change to Makefile.PL
