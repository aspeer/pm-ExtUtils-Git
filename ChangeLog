	* CVS.pm, support/dist_ci.inc: No longer 'touch' files that have
	  mtime out of sync with CVS status, allow 'cvs status' to do this
	  for us. Modify the may we go through the CVS 'Entries' file, read
	  it all in at once and iterate. Previously going through it line
	  by line, but were doing 'cvs' operations that changed it while we
	  were iterating - result was missed some files, did some
	  needlessly

	  Update dist_ci to do 'cvs status' before check-in to update file
	  timestamps if needed.

	* CVS.pm: Finished ci_mtime_sync method, allows mtime of file to be
	  synced back to the CVS mtime, thus making mtime checks module
	  files more robost, as an update -C does not fool it into thinking
	  a file has changed, just because its mtime has.

	  No change to Makefile.PL
